# Respect and Reason Driven Development

## Respect

We all work in teams that consist of people with different strength and
weaknesses, expirience and believes. And at the end of a day it doesn't really
matters whether you use spaces or tabs -- we all work on the same thing. Respect
your colleagues and be prepared to listen to what they have to say. Reach a
consensus before you implement anything. And make sure that everyone on
the team understands why that particular descision has been made.


## Reason

Be reasonable at all times. Learn to listen to other's opinions and try to
understand they point of view. Learn to manage your time and concentrate on the
most important problems at hand.


## Bullet Points

* **respect** your colleagues;
* **respect** your developer-colleagues even more;
* ...and don't forget about admins, devopses and testers;
* think about other when writing code;
* ...any code;
* concentrate on making your code as readable as possible -- the fact that you
  have a deadline shouldn't affect other developers, when time comes for them to
  maintaine it, and the project as a whole;
* but be **reasonable** about it -- don't turn a simple piece of code into a
  12-patterns, 50-modules and 30-tasks monstrocity;
* cover code written by you with tests to make other's life easier;
